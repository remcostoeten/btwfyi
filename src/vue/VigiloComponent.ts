/**
 * Re-export the Vigilo Vue component.
 * Users should import this component directly from 'btwfyi/vue/Vigilo.vue'
 * in their Vue applications, as their bundler (Vite, webpack, etc.) will handle .vue files.
 * 
 * For TypeScript support, you can also import the component definition:
 * import Vigilo from 'btwfyi/vue/Vigilo.vue'
